  Weekly Problem Contests.

<p class="f5 lh-copy">
  CMIT holds a Weekly Problem Contest (WPC) where a set of problems are sent out as an open-to-all contest for students and asked for independent solution submissions. Innovative solutions are noted and published on our site.
</p>
<p class="f5 lh-copy">
  Note that copying total solutions from any source is heavily discouraged and destroys the objective of such a contest. You can submit your solutions (in any form of media) to mathsclub [at] iisertvm [dot] ac [dot] in with a subject line of the form “Solution Submission to Week X Problems”.  Solution writers will be mentioned and leaderboarded, and can present their solutions at the next session of the club.

        <b>Bonus Problem: August 06, 2019</b>
        <br>In memory of the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel who was born on August 05, 1802, CMIT has a bonus problem this week. What makes this special is that the first person to send in the correct solution to the Bonus Problem will win a piece of the rare and highly sought after Hagoromo Fulltouch White ‘smooth and dustless’ chalk. Last date of submission is not defined for this problem.
