      <description>$S^2$: CMIT&#39;s Second Foundation Anniversary.The club is turning two years old this September 28th, 2020. Over these years, we have been actively engaged to facilitate the growth of a mathematical community among students at the institute, and we look forward to a long way ahead. To commemorate this anniversary, we are hosting a mini online symposium and some fun online contests.What is $S^2$? &amp;nbsp; CMIT&#39;s foundation anniversary celebrations are called $S^n$, where $n$ stands for the $n^{th}$ anniversary&amp;trade;.</description>

      <description>$S^3$: CMIT&#39;s Third Foundation Anniversary.Three years ago, on the 28th of September, 2018 the Club of Mathematics, IISER Thiruvananthapuram (CMIT), was founded with the intention of providing a platform for the students to discuss and learn where they felt free to express themselves. We also wanted to make it possible for them to indulge in various activities and events throughout the year. We have been organising talk series, peer discussion sessions, math-based contests, and various other events to facilitate a mathematical community among students at the institute, alongside the regular academic curriculum.</description>

      <description>Weekly Problem Contests (archived).CMIT hosted Weekly Problem Contests (WPC) where a set of problems were sent out as an open-to-all contest for students and asked for independent solution submissions. Innovative solutions were noted and published on our site.Note that copying total solutions from any source is heavily discouraged and destroys the objective of such a contest. You can submit your solutions (in any form of media) to mathsclub [at] iisertvm [dot] ac [dot] in with a subject line of the form “Solution Submission to Week X Problems”.</description>
