      <description>The CMIT official Discord server.One principal motive of CMIT has always been to discuss about mathematics and help each other in the community. After the success of our first web-based discussion portal in 2020, we moved over to CMIT&#39;s own Discord server. The server has wonderful functionality alongside LaTeX support, dedicated reading groups, and various discussion channels.The CMIT Discord server is a place to discuss mathematics, solve problems, share information and participate in math related events at CMIT and elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Weekly Problem Contests (archived).CMIT hosted Weekly Problem Contests (WPC) where a set of problems were sent out as an open-to-all contest for students and asked for independent solution submissions. Innovative solutions were noted and published on our site.Note that copying total solutions from any source is heavily discouraged and destroys the objective of such a contest. You can submit your solutions (in any form of media) to mathsclub [at] iisertvm [dot] ac [dot] in with a subject line of the form “Solution Submission to Week X Problems”.</description>
