      <description>Weekly Problem Contests.CMIT holds a Weekly Problem Contest (WPC) where a set of problems are sent out as an open-to-all contest for students and asked for independent solution submissions. Innovative solutions are noted and published on our site.Note that copying total solutions from any source is heavily discouraged and destroys the objective of such a contest. You can submit your solutions (in any form of media) to mathsclub [at] iisertvm [dot] ac [dot] in with a subject line of the form “Solution Submission to Week X Problems”.</description>
